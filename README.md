#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 2.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-31.md)

Malte and I did a bit deeper into the sources of the performance discrepancies between GraphX and Timely dataflow. We measure many things, and work through some neat time series that look like

#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 1.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-08.md)

Malte Schwarzkopf and I look in to the question of to what degree does improving networking help in graph computation. We do some measurement, comparing a PageRank implementation in both GraphX and in Timely dataflow.

#### [Differential graph computation](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-05-12.md)

Prompted by reader questions, we take a light tour through some of the things that differential dataflow can do.

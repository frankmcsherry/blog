# Exploring Social Trends on Bluesky

Twitter was, for a period, a really fascinating place to watch authentic human interaction unfold.
You could crawl all the tweets, query a few APIs, or drink from the firehose.
You can track trending hashtags, exploding viral content, and engaging conversations, all as it happens.
Twitter eventually put the firehose behind a paywall, and .. it also stopped being Twitter.

One of the recent upsides is that way more folks are now on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app), which has [a public firehose](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/firehose).

Today we're going to pull data from the Bluesky firehose into [Materialize](https://materialize.com).
And great news, you can follow along by grabbing the recently released [Community Edition](https://materialize.com/get-started/).
The link will still work by the end of the post, so if it sounds interesting enough by then, have a click.
And, I'll stress this now but you'll see, it is so much more compelling to see the data change than to look at results that have been copy/pasted;
you'll want to go and see the data changing live yourself!

## Ingesting Bluesky into Materialize

The first thing we'll need to do is get data flowing into Materialize.
I'm going to do this with some Javascript.
I don't really know Javascript, but I'm hoping that by revealing this and what I've written, folks may teach me something.
So, not the best Javascript, but it will get data from Bluesky into Materialize.

In fact I'm going to use [Bluesky's Jetstream](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream), which is a digested form of the firehose, minus the Merkle tree authenticating structure, and presented in JSON rather than CBOR.
There are several publicly available replicas of that one can simply connect a web socket to, and read out of.
Let's start with that: create and connect web sockets to both a Jetstream instance, and my Materialize instance.

```javascript
// Connection information; put your Materialize stuff here.
const MZ_ADDR = <REDACTED>;
const MZ_AUTH = {
    user: <REDACTED>,
    password: <REDACTED>,
};

// Bluesky Jetstream connection (input)
const bsky_uri = 'wss://jetstream2.us-east.bsky.network/subscribe?wantedCollections=app.bsky.feed.*';
const bsky_socket = new WebSocket(bsky_uri);
bsky_socket.onopen = () => {
    console.log('Connected to Bluesky WebSocket');
}
bsky_socket.onerror = (error) => { 
    console.error('Bluesky WebSocket error:', error); 
}

// Materialize connection (output)
const mz_uri = `wss://${MZ_ADDR}/api/experimental/sql`;
const mz_socket = new WebSocket(mz_uri);
mz_socket.onopen = () => {
    mz_socket.send(JSON.stringify(MZ_AUTH));
    console.log('Connected to Materialize WebSocket');
}
mz_socket.onerror = (error) => { 
    console.error('Materialize WebSocket error:', error); 
}
```

This opens up some connections, says what we should do with errors, but doesn't actually wire up any behavior yet.
Our plan is to peel off messages from `bsky_socket` as fast as we can, buffering them up and writing them at `mz_socket` in batches to support a high throughput.
We'll have a queue `pending_data` of data to insert, and a boolean `awaiting_mz` that tells us if we have an outstanding `INSERT` that we are awaiting (and should buffer until it returns).

```javascript
// Unsent messages, and a Materialize status bit.
let pending_data = [];
let awaiting_mz = false;
```

With this shared state, we'll next write the `onmessage` logic for both sockets.
The `bsky_socket` logic wants to react to data either by sending it on `mz_socket`, or by enqueueing it in `pending_data`.
We also need to escape the text content, and let's not pretend that I did a great job of that.

```javascript
// A received message should be sent immediately unless we know an insertion is in flight.
bsky_socket.onmessage = (msg) => {
    let escaped = "'" + msg.data.replace(/'/g, "''") + "'";
    if (pending_data.length === 0 && (mz_socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) && !awaiting_mz) {
        mz_socket.send(JSON.stringify({query: "INSERT INTO bsky VALUES ( " + escaped + " );"}));
        awaiting_mz = true;
    }
    else {
        pending_data.push(escaped);
    }
}
```

The `mz_socket` logic wants to await a `ReadyForQuery` response, and if there is now pending data prepare and ship all of it to Materialize.
We're assuming a table `bsky` with a single text column, which we'll need to create in Materialize.

```javascript
// Ready responses should send pending data, or unset the awaiting_mz bit.
mz_socket.onmessage = (msg) => {
    if (JSON.parse(msg.data).type === 'ReadyForQuery') {
        awaiting_mz = false;
    }
    if (pending_data.length > 0 && !awaiting_mz) {
        const query = "INSERT INTO bsky VALUES ( " + pending_data.join(' ), ( ') + " );";
        mz_socket.send(JSON.stringify({query: query}));
        pending_data = [];
        awaiting_mz = true;
    }
    else if (JSON.parse(msg.data).type === 'Error') {
        console.log("Error: " + msg.data);
    }
}
```

That's it!
I will not be taking any questions on whether this is correct, how the concurrency works out, or whether I am open to recanting my computer science degree.
Channeling this new AI era, it runs and does some stuff and doesn't print errors, so it probably works!

I'm not actually running this just yet, because I haven't made the `bsky` table just yet.
Once you've done that, you can `node thatfilethere.js` and it should start importing content for you.

## Working with Bluesky in SQL

Let's hop over to the Materialize side.
I'm using our Console, but you should also be able to `psql` in if you prefer that.

First up let's create that table we need.
```sql
CREATE TABLE bsky(x TEXT);
```
We can start with a quick query just to see that the data are flowing.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bsky;
```
You can either run query a few times to see the counts increasing (I hope), or you can [`SUBSCRIBE`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/subscribe/) to a changefeed of the results (each time the count changes, from what old to what new values).
I watched this for a little while, because it was fascinating to see it finally work, but ideally it *just works* for you and your interest may soon wane.
Let's move on!

The data come in as text, but let's quickly put a view in place that converts it to JSON.
This will just make it easier to work with in all subsequent steps.
```sql
CREATE VIEW bsky_json AS SELECT x::jsonb FROM bsky;
```

With these views in place, let's try and tease out some of the JSON structure.

### Jetstream's JSON Structure

I have no idea what the fields are in the JSON we get out of Jetstream.
I'm sure we can read about it together, but let's just use SQL to look instead.
```sql
-- Unpack all JSON key paths in the input data.
WITH MUTUALLY RECURSIVE
-- List of text keys, followed by the remaining JSON.
paths (path TEXT LIST, blob JSONB) AS (
    SELECT LIST[]::TEXT LIST, x FROM bsky_json
    UNION ALL
    SELECT paths.path || jok.key, jok.value
    FROM paths, jsonb_each(blob) jok
)
-- Count the paths and order lexicographically.
SELECT 
    COUNT(*),
    repeat('  ', list_length(path)) || path[list_length(path)] key
FROM paths 
GROUP BY path 
ORDER BY path;
```
This query recursively unpacks all paths down JSON objects, recording the keys in a text list.
It does miss some things, like JSON arrays, but you could add them in if you understand what they imply (I do not, for these records).
The output looks like so:
```text
| count | key                         |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 9303  | null                        |
| 11    |   account                   |
| 11    |     active                  |
| 11    |     did                     |
| 11    |     seq                     |
| 3     |     status                  |
| 11    |     time                    |
| 9283  |   commit                    |
| 9131  |     cid                     |
| 9283  |     collection              |
| 9283  |     operation               |
| 9131  |     record                  |
| 9131  |       $type                 |
| 18    |       allow                 |
| 9131  |       createdAt             |

  ...

| 9     |     seq                     |
| 9     |     time                    |
| 9303  |   kind                      |
| 9303  |   time_us                   |
```
The `null` is the root, and each of the indented keys are path continuations from the parent.
So, for example `blob->'commit'->'record'->'createdAt'` exists for 9,131 records; most of them.

With this information in hard, we can start to create some views, and pick out the meaning of each of these entries.

### Building Views over Bluesky JSON

The JSON we are seeing come from several different "collections", which I think are semantically distinct piles of data.
The stuff we are going to look at are posts and replies, both of which are from the `'app.bsky.feed.post'` collection.
The distinction between a post and a reply seems to be whether `blob->'commit'->'record'->'reply'` exists (reply) or not (post).
```sql
CREATE VIEW posts AS 
SELECT * 
FROM bsky_json 
WHERE x -> 'commit' ->> 'collection' = 'app.bsky.feed.post' 
  AND x -> 'commit' -> 'record' -> 'reply' IS NULL;

CREATE VIEW replies AS 
SELECT * 
FROM bsky_json 
WHERE x -> 'commit' ->> 'collection' = 'app.bsky.feed.post' 
  AND x -> 'commit' -> 'record' -> 'reply' IS NOT NULL;
```
At this point, we can hang out and watch the numbers of posts and replies roll past.
One variation on that: we could watch the number of posts and replies in the past minute.
To do this, we'll subscribe to a count for each, with the condition that `mz_now()` is at most the time of the event plus 60 seconds.
That is, an event contributes to a count until Materialize's time runs 60s past the event's time.
```sql
SUBSCRIBE ( SELECT (
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts   WHERE mz_now() < ((x->>'time_us')::bigint/1000 + 60000)),
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM replies WHERE mz_now() < ((x->>'time_us')::bigint/1000 + 60000))
));
```
This continually churns (updating potentially every millisecond; the granularity of Materialize's internal clock).
```
| count | count |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2097  | 2365  |
```

The numbers go up and down, as new posts and replies are introduced and old ones age out.
Seemingly, there are about two thousand post and reply events each minute, at least according to this feed.
Also, according to my limited understanding of the events.
I think some of these events are "updates" and "deletes" of events also, rather than just creating posts and replies.

### Tracking Active Posts

Let's try and do something non-trivial with these posts and replies.
Let's reassemble conversations that happened, by stitching together each reply with the post (or reply) it is in response to.

To start with, we can parse out some information from replies.
Here we'll grab the commid ids (cids; is that what it means?) of the reply, its immediate parent, and the root of the conversation (helpfully recorded in the record).
```sql
CREATE VIEW replies_parsed AS 
SELECT x -> 'commit' ->> 'cid' AS reply_cid, 
       x -> 'commit' -> 'record' -> 'reply' -> 'parent' ->> 'cid' AS parent_cid, 
       x -> 'commit' -> 'record' -> 'reply' -> 'root' ->> 'cid' AS root_cid,
       x->>'did' AS author,
       x->>'time_us'::BIGINT/1000 AS time_ms
FROM replies;
```
We can now look for the most active posts, as a function of replies, again over a window:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), root_cid
FROM replies_parsed
WHERE mz_now() < time_ms + 60000
GROUP BY root_cid
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

```
| count | root_cid                                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 457   | bafyreihol3ppt7jj52zivi6djiut7m4d2slsprhgybbjt63flzqiazwmsq |
| 423   | bafyreif62rrfx5vcy7xk2rvqhkwcwfmcxxzb2ob33ebbumgi3zj3ommnnq |
| 334   | bafyreiaz7ptvfughykm3rfdnnal7bmjs3szu32sfjo3vvgf3byh4p4uvjq |
| 302   | bafyreickr7u7ubpysd7yxaeihzp2sfxp6yrsfyffrfskeiykosw343qgsa |
| 197   | bafyreiejz6tpslyqzrys746emq7upj66heiksnshxe56zg63mzelamheme |
| 186   | bafyreicwdh6e43warxr4pyxh5ekr5c5h3ml2vw4uuqj2cymf7k2orwmxwq |
| 182   | bafyreigm6wud75b6q5fmly3qhcl5hdop3rr6wf3xfvm6j4w4fbyrpuhsyu |

| 159   | bafyreidleak3ozywmgeqxzvswya324dw2t4pjy22nr2ufulphcqnwzwoxm |
```
That's .. not super clear.
Fortunately, we can unpack each record and produce a URL that leads to the post.
The URL scheme is 
```
https://bsky.app/profile/<DID>/post/<RKEY>
```
and we'll just need to join with `posts` and extract the `did` and `rkey` fields.
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT author) AS participants,
    COUNT(*),
    'https://bsky.app/profile/' || (x->>'did') || '/post/' || (x->'commit'->>'rkey') AS url
FROM replies_parsed, posts
WHERE mz_now() < time_ms + 60000
  AND root_cid = x->'commit'->>'cid'
GROUP BY 3
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
These are now clickable links, continually updated, reporting the hottest posts.
```
| count | url                                                                          |

```
The number one here is AOC talking about Cloture, which .. probably isn't what's on Twitter at the moment.

If you are eager, we could swap the `COUNT(*)` to a `COUNT(DISTINCT author)` which would score posts by the number of participants, rather than their volume.
You could even print both, to get a sense for how closely related they are.
```
| participants | count | url                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 282          | 334   | https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:p7gxyfr5vii5ntpwo7f6dhe2/post/3lkbzb5qzdk2u |

```
It turns out they are pretty correlated, which actually feels pretty good to me.

### Monitoring Distributions (of Participants)

What else? We could count look at the distribution over the number of distinct participants, to see what levels of broad interaction occur across all of Bluesky.
```sql
SELECT participants, COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author) AS participants
    FROM replies_parsed
    WHERE mz_now() < time_ms + 60000
    GROUP BY root_cid
)
GROUP BY participants
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
```
| participants | count |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 1            | 27384 |
| 2            | 7374  |
| 3            | 2048  |
| 4            | 887   |
| 5            | 444   |
| 6            | 255   |
| 7            | 177   |
| 8            | 126   |
| 9            | 91    |
| 10           | 72    |

  ...

| 179          | 1     |
| 251          | 1     |
| 282          | 1     |
| 373          | 1     |
| 441          | 1     |
```
AOC's post is the 282, but what's going on with those larger posts?
It turns out they happened before we started capturing data, so we can see replies mentioning a post, but we don't have the post itself.

### Looking for Interactions

Let's put some parts together to make something a bit more complicated.
Posts with lots of responses may be easy, because folks just blurt out their takes.
What does real *interaction* look like?
How about we look for paths from the post through replies where authors change, scoring each path by the number of author alternations?
```sql
CREATE VIEW conversations AS 
WITH MUTUALLY RECURSIVE 
    seeds (root text, author text) AS (
        SELECT x -> 'commit' ->> 'cid', x->>'did'
        FROM posts
    ),
    links (root text, node text, author text, depth int4, responses int4) AS (
        SELECT root, root, author, 0, 0
        FROM seeds 
        UNION ALL 
        SELECT 
            links.root, 
            replies_parsed.reply_cid, 
            replies_parsed.author, 
            depth + 1, 
            responses + CASE WHEN links.author != replies_parsed.author THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
        FROM links, replies_parsed 
        WHERE links.node = replies_parsed.parent_cid
    ) 
-- For each post, extract the reply chain with the most interactions / alternations.
SELECT DISTINCT ON (root) *
FROM links 
ORDER BY root, responses DESC;

CREATE VIEW linked AS
SELECT
    responses,
    'https://bsky.app/profile/' || (x->>'did') || '/post/' || (x->'commit'->>'rkey') AS url
FROM
    conversations c,
    replies r
WHERE
    x -> 'commit' ->> 'cid' = c.node;
```
Selecting the top ten rows by responses produces
```
| responses | url                                                                          |

```
AOC's post registered a 6 for responses.
Not in the top 10, but is it good?
Let's check out the distribution.
```
| responses | count |
| --------- | ----- |
| 16        | 1     |

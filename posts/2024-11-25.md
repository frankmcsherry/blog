# Understanding Consistency in Materialize

Materialize draws data in from multiple external transactional sources of data, and provides a "consistent" view over the ensemble of data.
In fact, one of its primary contributions is the introduction of structure that both:
1. faithfully reflects the transactional state of each input, and 
2. brings together multiple transactional inputs in a single timeline.

How Materialize pulls this off is both subtle and at the same time surprisingly straight-forward.
We'll unpack how this unfolds, starting from your transactional source of truth, on through integrations with other sources, and across many independently authored and maintained SQL views.

## Consistency and Change Data Capture (CDC)

Let's start with a hypothetical transactional source of business data (e.g., PostgreSQL).
It will contain three tables, `product`, `client`, and `sales`, each containing the current state of the relevant information.
As time passes, these tables may change.
Let's draw a sparkline indicating the moments at which these tables change.
```text
OLTP DB
-------
product 0----------*----*-----**-------->
 client 0----------*----*----*-*-------->
  sales 0----------*----*----***-------->
```
What we've drawn here for each is a line going from left to right. 
Each starts at some initial moment `0--`, experiences updates at each `-*-`, up to its current state indicated by `-->`.

The vertical stacking of the lines means to suggest transactional consistency: tables may update at exactly the same time.
A "serializable" database is one where there is such a linear timeline: each transaction occurs atomically, in some total order.
Let's represent this with a vertical line to indicate a transactionally consistent view.

```text
OLTP DB          <- consistent view ->
-------                    |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->
```
I've dropped a vertical line at an arbitrary aesthetically appealing location, but everything we'll discuss checks out for *any* vertical line.
The vertical lines will define what it means to be transactionally consistent, for this post at least.

One of the most appealing properties of a database is that it masks the complexity of continually updating data, and presents as if it goes through a sequence of consistent states.
If you were to drop in to the OLTP database and issue a query, the answer would be as if we stopped the world for long enough to get the precise answer at some moment.

Consider for example, a reporting query like so:
```sql
  -- Avg of big-ticket sales, by client.
  SELECT client.name, AVG(sales.amount)
    FROM client, sales
   WHERE client.c_id = sales.c_id
     AND sales.amount > 100;
GROUP BY client.name
```
Although this brings together information from all across `sales`, with each record potentially altering some result, the output would be as if executed atomically at some vertical line dropped through the timelines of the tables.
If every `sales.c_id` has a corresponding `client.c_id`, we will be sure to find it.
If multiple sales were part of the same transaction, we'll see either all of them or none of them.

However, providing the appearance of transactional updates is taxing for an OLTP database.
Ad-hoc query processing interferes with the continual updates to the source tables, and the longer a query needs to run the greater the skew between its results and reality.
This is where Materialize comes in.

## Differential Dataflow and Virtual Time

The timelines we've drawn are not only a helpful way of thinking about transactional systems, they are also a tool for ensuring consistency.
In Materialize, and Differential Dataflow (the engine on which it builds), they are *the* tool for ensuring consistency.

Recall our sparkline from above, annotated with `OLTP` to remind us where that comes from.

```text
product 0----------*----*-----**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*----*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*----***-------->   /
```
Imagine that each update `-*-` happens at an explicitly recorded moment in time.
We'll pick those times to ensure transactional consistency: all updates for any one transaction get an identical timestamp.

Let's start with what might be the first part of the SQL query above: restricting our attention to sales with an amount of more than 100.
This is only a function of `sales`, but we can place the result in the context of all of the data.
```text
product 0----------*----*-----**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*----*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*----***-------->   /

WHERE sales.amount > 100                    \ Differential
        0----------*-----------*-------->   / Dataflow (DD)
```
The `WHERE` clause gets its own timeline, consistent with all the other timelines.
This timeline is *exactly determined from* the timeline of the `sales` table.
Each `-*-` update in `sales` may (or may not) result in a corresponding update in the result.
We can determine the exact timeline, conceptually at least, by moving through time moment by moment, and observing how the output must change as a function of the input and the query logic.

Were we to drop a vertical line for some view of the data, consistency still checks out.
```text
OLTP DB          <- consistent view ->
-------                    |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->   /
                           |
WHERE sales.amount > 100   |                \ Differential
        0----------*-------|---*-------->   / Dataflow (DD)
```
Although the OLTP database and Differential Dataflow are not even running on the same system, we can still make specific statements about the consistency of the results.
Each moment in the output timeline corresponds to a specific moment in the input timelines.

Differential Dataflow is fundamentally a tool for transforming input timelines to the exactly corresponding output timelines, for a small set of building-block operators.
In addition to `WHERE` (filtering), there are operators for `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and other primitives out of which one can build SQL.

Let's add the operators that correspond to our SQL view into the stack of timelines: 
```text
product 0----------*----*-----**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*----*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*----***-------->   /

WHERE sales.amount > 100                    \
        0----------*-----------*-------->   |
JOIN client ON (c_id)                       | SQL
        0----------*---------*-*-------->   | view
GROUP BY client.name                        |
        0----------*---------*-*-------->   /
```
Once we have filtered `sales` we join with `client`, producing a collection that may change whenever either input changes.
We then group by client id and aggregate the results, producing a collection that can only change when its input does.
As before, each timeline is determined from its input timelines and the query logic.

Also as before, the exact correspondence is a basis for consistency.
If we drop a vertical line, we are able to align a consistent view over the inputs and their corresponding outputs.
```text
                 <- consistent view ->
                           |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->   /
                           |
WHERE sales.amount > 100   |                \
        0----------*-------|---*-------->   |
JOIN client ON (c_id)      |                | SQL
        0----------*-------|-*-*-------->   | view
GROUP BY client.name       |                |
        0----------*-------|-*-*-------->   /
```
This consistency comes despite the OLTP inputs and the SQL view outputs being on two otherwise independent systems.
The explicit timelines are the only mechanism coordinating the two systems.
They are nonetheless powerful enough to exactly correlate input data and output results.

## Materialize

Differential Dataflow provides the building blocks for transforming timelines, but Materialize is what assembles those blocks into a full SQL experience.

Stepping back, there are three tasks Materialize performs that we'll want to call out in order to build a fuller system.
1.  Ingest each OLTP input as transitions on a common timeline. 

    Our examples above used a single OLTP input, with multiple tables, but you may have tables from multiple independent sources you are bringing together.
    Materialize cannot make independent sources become consistent (a very hard distributed systems problem), but it can place all of them on a **common timeline**.
    Each input will be internally consistent (i.e., transactions respected by Materialize), with an opinionated take about how their timelines interleave.

2.  Maintain the consistent timelines for any composition of derived views.

    We saw an example of a relatively simple SQL view above, and how one might reason about the relationship between its inputs and outputs.
    This only gets more complicated with multiple views, authored independently, executing across independent compute hardware.

3.  Determine how to respond to user queries.

    We dropped a vertical line to indicate the consistent moment at which we might provide a query response.
    Who chooses where to drop this vertical line, and what are the trade-offs in responsiveness, freshness, and consistency?

### Data Ingestion

Materialize's [`CREATE SOURCE`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/) command allows you to bring in a collection of transactionally consistent tables from an external upstream source.
The source is Materialize's unit of internal consistency: all tables from the same source will update in lock-step with the transitions of their input tables, always consistent with one another.
Updates to tables from different sources will be put in *an* order, by virtue of being put in a timeline, but that order may not reflect external causal constraints.

```text
                 <- consistent view ->
                           |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->   | OLTP 1
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->   /
                           |
reports 0---------*----*---|-**--------->   \
  deals 0---------*----*---|*-*--------->   | OLTP 2
  money 0---------*----*---|***--------->   /
                           |
```
Notice how there is a bit of skew between what might be related update events.
Consistency is nonetheless defined by the vertical line through timelines.

By putting all source updates onto a common timeline, Materialize introduces foundational structure that is otherwise missing.
It is admittedly guessing a bit, about how updates to unrelated sources interleave, but having done so there is now one view of all sources, shared by all users.
Materialize resolves and locks down one source of ambiguity, so that all downstream uses can be consistent with each other, and with each source individually.

The problem of putting multiple unrelated sources in a consistent order is fundamentally hard.
While you may know that you update your MySQL before your PostgreSQL, no one else knows this.
Database systems don't yet have great hooks for exposing these levels of cross-system constraints, and most solutions are bespoke (e.g., causality tokens).
Materialize's common timelines are one way to *introduce* this structure, and make it available going forward.

### View Maintenance

Materialize maintains views using Differential Dataflow (DD), which - as sketched above - translates input timelines to output timelines.
While DD ensures that the input and output timelines align perfectly, this comes at a cost: the output timelines are likely not immediately available.

Let's return to our example from before, but pay attention to the arrowheads `-->` indicating the extent of completed work.
```text
                 <- consistent view ->
                           |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->   /
                           |
WHERE sales.amount > 100   |                \
        0----------*-------|---*------>     |
JOIN client ON (c_id)      |                | SQL
        0----------*-------|-*-*---->       | view
GROUP BY client.name       |                |
        0----------*-------|-*-*-->         /
```
The arrowheads necessarily lag the arrowheads of the immediate inputs.
In order to know the answer for some dropped vertical, the input must also have advanced, and then some (ideally small) amount of time is required to establish and express confidence in the answer.

Understandably, you are probably most interested in results for verticals near the arrowheads of your input data: these represent the freshest views of your data.
At the same time, these are also where the lag, however slight, prevents you from immediately knowing the answer.

Materialize, and DD underlying it, are optimized around reducing the lag of these arrowheads.
As much work is done ahead of time as is possible, so that the moment you say "show me now!" we are ideally just a few confirmations away from having the correct answer in hand.
Importantly, when we say "correct answer" we mean it.
The dropped vertical means we will show you a result that corresponds **exactly** to your inputs at the same moment.

Everything we've said about DD operators generalizes to SQL views.
```text
                 <- consistent view ->
                           |
product 0----------*----*--|--**-------->   \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*-------->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***-------->   /
                           |
CREATE VIEW big_sales AS   |
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sales.amount > 100
        0----------*-------|-***--->
                           |
CREATE VIEW client_vol AS  |
SELECT c_id, COUNT(*) FROM client GROUP BY c_id
        0----------*-------|--*------>
                           |
SELECT * FROM big_sales JOIN client_vol ON (c_id)
        0----------*-------|--**-->
```
Here we've created several views, each with an output timeline, as well as a query that brings the views together.
Despite no knowledge that the views were designed to be used together, Materialize ensures that they can only be viewed consistently.

I've also shiften the arrowheads `-->` around to remind you that it may not be what you think.
Although each view cannot be farther ahead than its inputs, their progress isn't necessarily in any other order.

### Timestamp Selection

Finally, who chooses these vertical lines?

Each dropped vertical line corresponds to a "timestamp" on the common timeline.
How we choose timestamps reflects the core product principles behind Materialize: responsiveness, freshness, and consistency.
These three are often in tension, but let's see what each corresponds to in isolation:
1.  **Responsiveness**: Always choose a timestamp to the left of (before) the arrowhead of the query.
    This ensures that Materialize is always able to immediately answer your question; no waiting!
2.  **Freshness**: Always choose a timestamp to the right of (after) all input arrowheads.
    This ensures that Materialize only responds with results that reflect the most recent input.
3.  **Consistency**: Always choose a timestamp to the right of (after) all previously chosen timestamps.
    This ensures that Materialize presents as moving forward through the common timeline, rather than jumping forwards and backwards.

You can now see how these might be in tension.

Let's look more closely at the potential interactions of three chosen timestamps.
Recall that multiple people may be using Materialize at the same time, and they may have different goals.
```text
                           T0       T1   T2
                           |        |    |
product 0----------*----*--|--**----|--->|  \
 client 0----------*----*--|-*-*----|--->|  | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*--|-***----|--->|  /
                           |        |    |
CREATE VIEW big_sales AS   |        |    |
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sales.amount > 100
        0----------*-------|-***->  |    |
                           |        |    |
CREATE VIEW client_vol AS  |        |    |
SELECT c_id, COUNT(*) FROM client GROUP BY c_id
        0----------*-------|--*-----|>   |
                           |        |    |
SELECT * FROM big_sales JOIN client_vol ON (c_id)
        0----------*-------|>       |    |
                           |        |    |
```

The `T0` timestamp is great for someone who wants to access a complex query (the last one) interactively.
The corresponding result is not nearly as up to date as others, but it is still available at a consistent moment.
In situations where you need a prompt and correct result, but not necessarily fresh, you can use `SERIALIZABLE` isolation to opt out of the consistency requirement.

The `T1` timestamp is great for someone who wants to access the `client_vol` view.
While also not immediately up to date, it is available at a relatively recent timestamp.
Combined with the `T0` use case, it should be clear how ensuring consistency (always go right) puts `T1`'s freshness in conflict with `T0`'s responsiveness.
They can't both get what they want at the same time, without some give.

The `T2` timestamp is for a freshness absolutist, who needs to be sure that they are seeing results that reflect reality _as of_ when the query was submitted.
Imagine presenting a bank balance back to a customer, or checking inventory levels before confirming a purchase.
While the freshness is great, as good as it gets, there are significant responsiveness limitations.
This level of freshness can be ensured by the ["zero-staleness"](https://materialize.com/blog/zero-staleness-faster-primary/) feature, which provides "real-time recency" guarantees.

### The Query Lifecycle

We've seen a bunch of complex pictures of common timelines, as they form the backbone of consistency in Materialize.
Most users, however, don't want to have to flip through these things to figure out what is going on with their query.
Fortunately, there is a simpler way to understand Materialize's operation in the context of individual queries.

Each query that arrives at Materialize is first assigned a timestamp.
The timestamp corresponds to the vertical line, and its choice is a reflection of the transaction isolation levels of the user's session.
There is some explaining to do about how your timestamp is chosen, which you can consult as you wait for your results.

But why are you waiting?
We've chosen a timestamp; what prevents the immediate presentation of that information?
The information you are looking for is essentially the progress bar for which arrowheads have passed the dropped vertical line.

Let's return to the example above, and the experience of a user assigned the `T1` timestamp.
```text
                                    T1   
                                    |     
product 0----------*----*-----**----|--->   \
 client 0----------*----*----*-*----|--->   | OLTP
  sales 0----------*----*----***----|--->   /
                                    |     
CREATE VIEW big_sales AS            |     
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sales.amount > 100
        0----------*---------***->  |     
                                    |     
CREATE VIEW client_vol AS           |     
SELECT c_id, COUNT(*) FROM client GROUP BY c_id
        0----------*----------*-----|>    
                                    |
CREATE VIEW analysis AS             |     
SELECT * FROM big_sales JOIN client_vol ON (c_id)
        0----------*-------->       |
                                    |
```
With `T1` locked in, Materialize can use its view of the arrowhead state, and the dependences among sources and views, to state the following:
```
Query SELECT * FROM analysis
query timestamp: T1
status:
input   sales        ready
input   client       ready
view    client_vol   ready
view    big_sales    refreshing
view    analysis     pending
```
As time advances, and arrowheads move rightwards, the arrowhead of `big_sales` will pass `T1`, changing to `ready` and moving `analysis` to the `refreshing` state, until it too advances to the right.
As time advances, more and more of the query steps transition to `ready`, until they are all ready - you should have your response imminently.
